# Phase 10 V1 Hardening

**Date:** 2026-06-01

**Plan Reference:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-05-31-ielts-v1-local-app.md`

## Completed Scope

- Continued development directly on `master`.
- Added V1 hardening service and API routes:
  - `GET /api/hardening/import-failures`,
  - `GET /api/hardening/question-bank-completeness`,
  - `GET /api/hardening/backup-reminder`,
  - `GET /api/hardening/status`.
- Added import failure reporting for unresolved `failed` and `needs_review` sources, including source path, status, version, and asset count.
- Added question-bank completeness checks for:
  - missing answer key,
  - missing explanation,
  - missing audio,
  - missing transcript,
  - missing listening cues,
  - missing frequency entry.
- Added backup reminder logic based on submitted attempt count and recent backup age.
- Added frontend readiness surfaces:
  - V1 hardening center,
  - import failure report,
  - question-bank completeness page,
  - backup reminder,
  - Baidu Cloud JSONL sync settings preview.
- Added UI empty states for:
  - no import issues,
  - no question-bank data,
  - no completed history,
  - no accuracy analytics,
  - no mistake labels.
- Expanded Playwright coverage for dashboard, import report, practice, mock exam, review, history, and sync settings anchors.

## Verification Evidence

- Red test evidence:
  - `apps/server/src/test/hardeningService.test.ts` first failed because `apps/server/src/services/hardeningService.ts` did not exist.
  - `apps/web/src/test/hardeningCenter.test.tsx` first failed because `apps/web/src/features/hardening/HardeningCenter.tsx` did not exist.
  - `pnpm test:e2e` first failed because the `Sync settings` region did not exist.
- Targeted verification:
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 --filter @ielts/server test -- src/test/hardeningService.test.ts`
    - 2 tests passed.
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 --filter @ielts/web test -- src/test/hardeningCenter.test.tsx`
    - 3 tests passed.
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 test:e2e`
    - 2 Playwright tests passed.
- Full verification:
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 test`
    - Shared: 3 tests passed.
    - Server: 39 tests passed.
    - Web: 22 tests passed.
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 build`
    - Shared TypeScript build passed.
    - Server TypeScript build passed.
    - Web TypeScript and Vite production build passed.
  - `npx pnpm@9.15.4 db:migrate`
    - Migration command completed with `Database migrations applied.`
- Browser verification:
  - Opened `http://127.0.0.1:5173/` in the in-app browser.
  - Confirmed the page title, V1 hardening center, and sync settings were present.
  - Confirmed no horizontal overflow at the checked viewport.

## Remaining V1 Gaps

- Phase 9 remains partially blocked by environment:
  - Windows local web mode is verified in GitHub Actions on `windows-2022`.
  - Mac `.dmg` packaging and packaged Mac hands-on checks are complete.
  - Windows `.exe` packaging is complete through the GitHub Actions artifact
    `ielts-local-practice-windows-nsis`.
  - A Windows verification kit artifact now ships with the installer and includes a
    manifest plus `windows-packaged-runtime-check.ps1`, including automated installer
    hash, installed executable discovery, app launch, process, app data checks, and
    structured `windows-packaged-runtime-report.json` output before the remaining UI
    checklist.
  - GitHub Actions run `26825215775` on `master` passed Windows unit tests, web
    build, Windows local web smoke, `desktop:check` with Rust packaged runtime
    diagnostics, Windows NSIS build, artifact uploads, and Windows packaged runtime
    silent-install plus launch smoke plus app data directory verification plus
    report-capable PowerShell verifier execution plus runtime report JSON validation
    plus runtime report artifact upload on `windows-2022`.
  - Windows packaged runtime diagnostics field construction is verified in CI, but
    the rendered diagnostics panel still needs hands-on inspection on a real
    Windows environment.
  - A repo-tracked Windows hands-on verification guide now documents the exact
    artifact set, PowerShell command, manual checklist, and report completion rule
    needed to close the remaining Phase 9 evidence gap.
  - Windows packaged runtime diagnostics, file picker, audio playback, PDF viewing,
    SQLite path, and sync folder path still need hands-on verification on a real
    Windows environment.
